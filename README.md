## [BiciMAD Age Cohort Prediction](https://github.com/jdecampo/xai_age_cohort_prediction_bss)

- Used **Python** to build a solution that estimate the age group of BiciMAD Bike Sharing System users (Macro F1 score: ~61%) based on trip data for year 2019.
- Combined bike usage, meteorological, and working calendar data using **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and **Folium** for enhanced data integration, analysis and visualization.
- Optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost Classifiers with(out) SMOTE using 5-fold stratified GridSearchCV/RandomSearch. Employed libraries like **Scikit-Learn**, **XGBoost**, **Imbalanced-Learn** and **Optuna** to identify the best-performing model.
- Revealed insights into the model's decision-making process using **SHAP** Feature Importance, choosing the best-performing model that balances robust performance with model explainability **XAI**.

## [Lung Colon Cancer Histopathological Imgages Classification](https://github.com/jdecampo/lung_colon_cancer_img_classification)

- Utilized **Python** to create a supportive tool designed to aid healthcare specialists, particularly oncologists, in the diagnosis and study of cancer. This tool, which achieves a model accuracy of 97%, leverages [histopathological imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12142v1) to assist clinical decision-making.
- Additionally, Deep Learning techniques, particularly computer vision (CNN, Transfer Learning-VGG16) were applied using a 2-fold stratified GridSearchCV. Libraries such as **TensorFlow**, **Keras** and **SciKeras** were employed to identify the most effective classifier.
